    "1.4.0": "- Improved the skylight calculations (eg. if you have hardcore darkness installed, it will be dark enough for Grues to spawn at night, courtesy of Laike Endaril)\n- The light detection code no longer takes artificial light into account (so Grues can spawn in the Nether, among other dimensions)\n- The timer stops ticking if you're already dead, as does the displaying of warning messages\n- The warning message is now displayed above the hotbar, instead of the top left corner\n- Added a loot table for the Grue (have fun trying to kill them, it's empty)\n- Added a config option to turn the dimension whitelist into a blacklist\n- Added a config option to toggle whether or not to display the warning text in the chat instead of above the hotbar\n- Added a configurable grace period that temporarily stops the Grue timer for a few seconds on dimension change\n- Replaced the spawning sounds with new ones (with more genuine growls and more fake reverb)\n- Now runs on Forge 14.23.4.2705"
